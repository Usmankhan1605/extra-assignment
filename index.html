<h2> Baking Perfect Cakes:</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Ingredients at room temperature</li>
<li>Use parchment paper for a clean release</li>
<li>Measure/weigh batter for even cake layers</li>
<li>Bake at a lower temperature for a longer time</li>
<li>Touch test instead of a toothpick</li>
<li>Cool the cakes completely in the pan</li>
<li>Chill cakes completely before leveling or icing</li>
<li>Leveling cake layers means cutting off the cake humps to create a flat surface. This makes the finished cake look spectacular! With even, flat layers, not only will the cake look great on the outside, but the inside as well. When you cut into the cake you will be able to see uniform layers.</li>
<li>Just as we are looking to achieve even layers of cake, perfect cakes have even layers of filling. Cake filling possibilities are endless. Buttercream, custards, mousses, and fruit fillings are the most common.</li>
<li>A crumb coat is essential to creating the perfect cake. The crumb coat is a very thin first layer of frosting that traps all of the cake crumbs so that when you put your final layer of frosting on, it is smooth and crumb-free.</li>
